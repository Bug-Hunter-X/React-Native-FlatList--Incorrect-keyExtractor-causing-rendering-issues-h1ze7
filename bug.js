This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and the data source changes frequently.  The keyExtractor prop is not correctly defined, which causes the FlatList to improperly render or update items, leading to visual glitches or unexpected behavior.  The keyExtractor function should return a unique and consistent identifier for each item in the data source. If it returns non-unique keys, FlatList has to re-render everything which is costly and leads to performance issues. 

Example of incorrect usage:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={[{id:1, text: 'Item 1'}, {id:2, text: 'Item 2'}, {id:1, text: 'Item 3'}]}
  renderItem={({item}) => <Text>{item.text}</Text>}
/>
```

In this case, the keyExtractor is missing, and the `id` values are not unique, causing issues when the data is updated.
